# Hours-Tracker
A java GUI interface that allows you to enter hours spent working each day and a log of what happened that day. A running count of the hours that week is tracked and past logs can be viewed. Everything is saved in outputted files, this is an older project if I were to remake this I would definitely consider either using a database or a JSON object.

How to run:
1. clone/download the repository
2. compile all the java files using javac *java
3. execute the Menu file with java Menu


All the folders must remain in the directory and must not be renamed, since this is where all the logs and weekly recordings are saved.
